This project was made for my TCMG 412 class

The program pulls a log file from the internet then divides them into months, calculates the amount fo requests made in total, per month, and per day.

The program also finds the most requested file and the least requested ones.

Some of the code in this project was recycled from two of my previous projects from my CSCE 110 class.
